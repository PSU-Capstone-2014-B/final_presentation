            Answer these questions:
            What does your product do? Why is it needed? Who will use it?

            Routelandia is a native android app that
            shows travel times along highways. To do this, it
            pulls historical traffic data from highways around
            the general Portland area.

            The hook is this app won't just give you a travel
            time for just one moment, but before and after it as well.
            It does this by looking at travel times in the near past
            to predict them in the future.

            Traffic tends to follow cycles, as anyone in
            rush-hour traffic can tell you. Routelandia lets you
            conveniently see what those cycles look like,
            letting anyone know when's the best time to hit the road.

            - Data is hard!
            - Information should be easy!

            ITS is an organization that has a place here at PSU. It stands for "Intelligent Transportation Systems". ITS' role here
            is to collect and analyze various information about traffic.
            PORTAL is a sub-group within ITS that has a more specific role. It stands for Portland, Oregon Regional Transportation
            Archive Listing. Their goal is to collect and archive various traffic data and statistics in the Portland Metro area.

            Nasim:  A powerful feature of information is performance-based trend representation. 
            Collecting -> diagnostics and statistical inference -> visualization and analysis of parameters -> performance trend -> optimization and evolutionary adaptation to rate of change.

              The two primary languages we used were Java, to create the front end,
              and php to create the back end. The supplied database was written in
              Postgres, and the back and front end communicate through a REST API with
              JSON objects.
              
              The front end mostly focused on using the supplied Android libraries
              to create the app, but several other libraries were used as well.
              The PolyUtil library allowed us to restrict users to only placing
              markers near our highways, improving the user experience, and 
              AChartEngine (yes,that's it's name) let us elegantly display our
              statistics.
              
              The back end also used some libraries in their programming.
              Restler allowed us to not just create but automatically document
              rest endpoints to communicate with the app. We also used
              respect/relational to manage the different database objects,
              and it all was tested using behat.

                Originally, Nasim and Jesse were assigned to work on UI design. Once this was finished, they were split up into the front/back-end team.

                Each sub team had a team lead and they managed that team,
                josh was back end team lead. The tasks removed from backends
                original plan happened when we restructured the project to
                make the backend the majority number cruncher. That required
                changing how we talked to the database, how we futz’d with that
                data and how we returned it.

                OWNER: Rob
                <p>Each of our schedules varied greatly. John has a full-time
                work schedule, Nasim is a student at two universities,
                Jesse has a job and a family. With this situation, we had
                to adopt a "modified" agile development method. It was not
                possible to hold daily standups, but we did have weekly
                meetings where we tracked our progress and set goals for
                the following week.</p>

                <p>Since our last presentation, we've had a few changes to the
                schedule we laid out for ourselves. As stated earlier, we
                were unable to implement highway chaining, but refined our
                monthly milestones such as successfully drawing lines over
                the freeways where there was data and writing queries for
                route statistics.</p>

                <p>Our handoff is pretty simple. Since our software is free,
                Portal will only need to deploy a build on their servers
                which the app on the Playstore will reference. No signing
                over rights or IP is necessary for this project.</p>

                  We discovered we would not be able to associate attributes to drawn
                  lines on google maps which caused us to have to restructure our project.
                  We responded by having one particularly long meeting figuring out how to
                  attack the project from this new angle.

                  We also had some issues with the PORTAL database, having null/empty spots.
                  Mitigated this by ignoring the bad data as it came in. Also the
                  database was going through a restructure as we were working on it
                  which caused us to have to get clever with the stats query.

                What we would’ve done differently

                First off in the backend, we would’ve wanted to choose a different language from PHP because PHP
                comes with a lot of quirks. Additionally the frameworks for PHP we were using didn’t have much
                support or documentation which made debugging difficult. The lack of search results outside of
                their main website is something that should’ve sent up red flags in the start during our research.
                Respect relational for example, required us to delve into their source code to figure out what was
                going on and how to get it to do what we wanted it to do, even for tasks we thought would be simple,
                like sending a raw SQL query to the database. The RESTler framework was better, had questions on
                stack overflow and barebones documentation allowed us to get by without delving into the source code.

                ———————————————
                Also the frameworks were just way too big for what backend needed to do, which was “create API
                for a database”. — Josh mentioned this, need to expand slightly on it
                ——————————————

                Something both the front end and back end didn’t do was setting up a proper testing environment
                before we started writing code. For most of the project the backend was testing all the api routes
                by hand which caused some niche api routes to break when someone forgot to test every single
                one with every commit. In a perfect world code reviews would catch these but some still managed
                to split through the cracks. It also made it hard to debug communication issues between front end
                and back end. When frontend would try to call an api route and it would break, it was always initially
                unclear if it was actually frontend’s or backend’s code at fault. Usually it was some combination
                of both.

                Front end initially assumed that android studios native android emulator would be sufficient
                enough to work on. However the emulator ran incredibly slow on our machines, to the point of
                making programming an incredibly frustrating process spending lots of time waiting instead
                of being productive. By the end front end had a couple of old android phones being shared
                between them which turned out to be better.

                Backend had the advantage of having someone with previous technical leadership experience,
                so we were able to set up a schedule we could all work in from the get-go that kept us on the
                same page. Because front end team members, like the rest of the team except josh, were all very
                new working in a project like this, they had some issues figuring out what worked for them and how
                to really get on their feet in terms of communication, goal setting and issue tracking. If they
                could do it over again they would’ve used the same management strategies that backend was using.

                If we had more time

                If we were where we are at now a month ago, we would’ve started working
                on an iOS app. Most of the team could work on it since the backend wouldn’t
                change, and we could use the lessons we learned from building the android app
                and apply them.

                However before we started the iOS app we’d want to work on multi-highway
                routing first because this was initially supposed to be in the app but had
                to be made a stretch goal after we did a major design change in terms of how
                the app communicated with the server. We discussed a lot of kind’ve hacky ways
                to go about it but would want to avoid because they relied on PHP doing the
                number crunching  instead of keeping all that heavy computation inside the database.
                After some research we discovered pg_routing would best suit our needs but it
                would require some non-significant design changes in the PORTAL database which
                would take time than we had to implement.

                Finally we wanted to add some kind of error reporting as a tool for us and
                PORTAL to highlight holes in the database or errors in the data. This would
                let us know how far off the mark our predictions were for travel time.
