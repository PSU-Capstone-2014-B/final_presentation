              Answer these questions:
              What does your product do? Why is it needed? Who will use it?

              Routelandia is a native android app that
              shows travel times along highways. To do this, it
              pulls historical traffic data from highways around
              the general Portland area.

              The hook is this app won't just give you a travel
              time for just one moment, but before and after it as well.
              It does this by looking at travel times in the near past
              to predict them in the future.

              Traffic tends to follow cycles, as anyone in
              rush-hour traffic can tell you. Routelandia lets you
              conveniently see what those cycles look like,
              letting anyone know when's the best time to hit the road.

              - Data is hard!
              - Information should be easy!

              ITS is an organization that has a place here at PSU. It stands for "Intelligent Transportation Systems". ITS' role here
              is to collect and analyze various information about traffic.
              Portal is a sub-group within ITS that has a more specific role. It stands for Portland, Oregon Regional Transportation
              Archive Listing. Their goal is to collect and archive various traffic data and statistics in the Portland Metro area.

              Nasim:  A powerful feature of information is performance-based trend representation. 
              Collecting -> diagnostics and statistical inference -> visualization and analysis of parameters -> performance trend -> optimization and evolutionary adaptation to rate of change.

              Once the highway data is loaded we display all of the highways that we have data for, drawing each as a unique color
              so that the user can pick two points along the same highway.

              The application enforces that the user taps a point within 200 meters of a highway, so that we can determine where
              along the highway they want to start and end their journey.

              The user then picks the time they're interested in traveling, and which day of the week.<br />
              Day of the week important, because the statistics we're about to see are generated for the last 6 weeks of the chosen
              weekday. This allows the user to determine if traffic on a Friday is different than traffic on a Tuesday.

              This shows the 4-hour block (2 hours to either side) of the user's chose time, broken up into 15 minute increments,
              letting the user see what the average travel time for their route, and average speed across their route is, during
              each 15 minute interval.<br />
              At the top you'll see a percentage accuracy measurement, which gives the user some sort of idea about how much to trust these numbers.

              If you rotate your phone sideways you'll see that we give the same information in a table, which includes the accuracy
              measurement for each 15 minute interval. Accuracy is the number of readings that the detectors in the chose route *should* have given
              off over a 15 minute interval, vs how many we actually got when we did the query.<br />
              This may not be as interesting to the end user, but to Portal/ODOT this information is interesting to know as it allows you to see trends in where detectors are firing every 20 seconds or not.

                  So, who did what? I split the teams up into three separate
                  groups initially: Front-end, Back-end and UI design. UI
                  design was a temporary team composed of Nasim and Jesse. They
                  were responsible with coming up with the look of the
                  front-end app. Once that was finished, I re-assigned Nasim to
                  the front-end and Jesse to the back-end.
                </p>
                <p>NEXT FRAGMENT - PRESS DOWN!!!</p>
                <p>
                  The front-end was composed of Loc, John and later
                  Nasim. Loc was put in charge of the sub-group and
                  responsible for putting down the groundwork for the
                  application. Nasim implemented several of the graphical
                  features such as the splash screen, date and time picker,
                  and statistics plot. John worked on testing and doing QA
                  work.
                </p>
                <p>NEXT FRAGMENT - PRESS DOWN!!!</p>
                <p>

                  The back-end had Josh, Peter and then Jesse. Josh was the
                  lead, bearded Wizard (their choice of title) and laid the
                  foundation for the server application as well as writing
                  the Postgres queries. Peter wrote lots of PHP code and took
                  the lead with working with the Front-end and decided how
                  the API structure would be implemented. When Jesse came on
                  board, because of his experience writing test code at work,
                  he took over the role of writing the entire test suite.

                  OWNER: Rob
                  <p>Each of our schedules varied greatly. John has a full-time
                  work schedule, Nasim is a student at two universities,
                  Jesse has a job and a family. With this situation, we had
                  to adopt a "modified" agile development method. It was not
                  possible to hold daily standups, but we did have weekly
                  meetings where we tracked our progress and set goals for
                  the following week.</p>

                  <p>Since our last presentation, we've had a few changes to the
                  schedule we laid out for ourselves. For example, we
                  were unable to implement highway chaining, but refined our
                  monthly milestones such as successfully drawing lines over
                  the freeways where there was data and writing queries for
                  route statistics.</p>

                  <p>Our handoff is pretty simple. Since our software is free,
                  Portal will only need to deploy a build on their servers
                  which the app on the Playstore will reference. No signing
                  over rights or IP is necessary for this project.</p>

                The two primary languages we used were Java, to create the front end,
                and php to create the back end. The supplied database was written in
                Postgres, and the back and front end communicate through a REST API with
                JSON objects.
                
                The front end mostly focused on using the supplied Android libraries
                to create the app, but several other libraries were used as well.
                The PolyUtil library allowed us to restrict users to only placing
                markers near our highways, improving the user experience, and 
                AChartEngine (yes,that's it's name) let us elegantly display our
                statistics.
                
                The back end also used some libraries in their programming.
                Restler allowed us to not just create but automatically document
                rest endpoints to communicate with the app. We also used
                respect/relational to manage the different database objects,
                and it all was tested using behat.

              We chose to use highways only because of the differences in the data structure for the arterials...<br />
              Clicking near the line was hard, Android doesn't seem to like objects on it's maps...<br />
              Multiple highways. Multi-path routing, different data types on arterials, missing sections, all hard problems!

                What we wouldâ€™ve done differently
                    
                    NEXT <br />
                <p>First off in the backend, we wouldâ€™ve wanted to choose different frameowrks 
                    The frameworks for PHP we were using didnâ€™t have much support or documentation which made debugging difficult.
                    </p>

                    NEXT <br />
                <p>Something both the front end and back end didnâ€™t do was setting up a proper testing environment
                    before we started writing code. </p>

                    NEXT
                    <br />
                <p>Front end initially assumed that android studios native android emulator would be sufficient
                    enough to work on. However the emulator ran incredibly slow on our machines, to the point of
                    making programming an incredibly frustrating process spending lots of time waiting instead
                    of being productive. By the end front end had a couple of old android phones being shared
                    between them which turned out to be better.</p>

                    NEXT
                    <br />
                <p>Backend had the advantage of having someone with previous technical leadership experience,
                    so we were able to set up a schedule we could all work in from the get-go that kept us on the
                    same page. </p>

                NEXT
                <br />
                <p>If we were where we are at now a month ago, we wouldâ€™ve started working on an
                    iOS app. Most of the team could work on it since the API wouldnâ€™t change, and we could
                    use the lessons we learned from building the android app and apply them. </p>

                NEXT
                <br />
                <p>However before we started the iOS app weâ€™d want to work on multi-highway routing
                    first because this was initially supposed to be in the app but had to be made a stretch
                    goal after we did a major design change in terms of how the app communicated with the
                    server. We discussed a lot of kindâ€™ve hacky ways to go about it but would want to avoid
                    because they relied on PHP doing the number crunching  instead of keeping all that
                    heavy computation inside the database.  After some research we discovered pg_routing
                    would best tool to suit our needs but it would require some non-trivial design changes in the
                    PORTAL database which would take time than we had to implement. </p>

                NEXT
                <br />
                <p>Finally we wanted to add some kind of error reporting as a tool for us and Portal
                    to highlight missing or incorrect data in the Portal database. This would let us know
                    how far off the mark our predictions were for travel time. </p>

              For most of us, this was the first time we had worked on a group coding project. we had some issues with communication between
			  different team members and teams but we worked hard at it and things got better. many of us had never coded for an android app
			  or setup a web server before and now we have gained skills we can hopefully use after school. This has been a rewarding 
			  experience for all of us and we hope our project is useful. Thank you
