          <h2>Basic Overview of Routelandia</h2>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Android App Presents travel times on highways near Portland</li>
            <li>historical data</li>
            <li>Traffic is vaguely cyclical</li>
            <li>Lets you know best time to hit highway</li>

            Answer these questions:
            What does your product do? Why is it needed? Who will use it?

            Routelandia is a native android app that
            shows travel times along highways. To do this, it
            pulls historical traffic data from highways around
            the general Portland area.

            The hook is this app won't just give you a travel
            time for just one moment, but before and after it as well.
            It does this by looking at travel times in the near past
            to predict them in the future.

            Traffic tends to follow cycles, as anyone in
            rush-hour traffic can tell you. Routelandia lets you
            conveniently see what those cycles look like,
            letting anyone know when's the best time to hit the road.

            - Data is hard!
            - Information should be easy!

            ITS is an organization that has a place here at PSU. It stands for "Intelligent Transportation Systems". ITS' role here
            is to collect and analyze various information about traffic.
            PORTAL is a sub-group within ITS that has a more specific role. It stands for Portland, Oregon Regional Transportation
            Archive Listing. Their goal is to collect and archive various traffic data and statistics in the Portland Metro area.

            Nasim:  A powerful feature of information is performance-based trend representation. 
            Collecting, archiving -> diagnostics and statistical inference -> visualization and analysis of parameters -> performance trend -> optimization and evolutionary adaptation to rate of change.

            <p>
              We split up into teams!
              <ul>
                <li class="fragment"><b>Front end</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Nasim is UI/UX in the front end and plot the statistics graph</li>
                    <li>Loc uses data from the backend draw highway in the map and sets up CI</li>
                    <li>John</li>

                </li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Josh is bearded wizard</li>
                    <li>Peter is tall wizard</li>
                    <li>Jesse is test wizard</li>

            <aside class="notes">
                OWNER: Rob
                Originally, Nasim and Jesse were assigned to work on UI design. Once this was finished, they were split up into the front/back-end team.

                Each sub team had a team lead and they managed that team,
                josh was back end team lead. The tasks removed from backends
                original plan happened when we restructured the project to
                make the backend the majority number cruncher. That required
                changing how we talked to the database, how we futzâ€™d with that
                data and how we returned it.

              <h2>Schedules and Process</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>"Full time Student" agile
                  <ul>
                    <li>No daily stand ups</li>
                    <li>Weekly meetings and goal setting</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Schedule changes</li>
                <li>Handoff will involve deploying the PHP backend onto the Portal Server</li>
              </ul>

              <aside class="notes">
                OWNER: Rob
                <p>Each of our schedules varied greatly. John has a full-time
                work schedule, Nasim is a student at two universities,
                Jesse has a job and a family. With this situation, we had
                to adopt a "modified" agile development method. It was not
                possible to hold daily standups, but we did have weekly
                meetings where we tracked our progress and set goals for
                the following week.</p>

                <p>Since our last presentation, we've had a few changes to the
                schedule we laid out for ourselves. As stated earlier, we
                were unable to implement highway chaining, but refined our
                monthly milestones such as successfully drawing lines over
                the freeways where there was data and writing queries for
                route statistics.</p>

                <p>Our handoff is pretty simple. Since our software is free,
                Portal will only need to deploy a build on their servers
                which the app on the Playstore will reference. No signing
                over rights or IP is necessary for this project.</p>

              <p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Significant design change halfway through project</li>
                  <li>Data from Portal had quirks</li>
                  <li>Portal was restructuring their database</li>

              <aside class="notes">
                  OWNER: Josh
                  We discovered we would not be able to associate attributes to drawn
                  lines on google maps which caused us to have to restructure our project.
                  We responded by having one particularly long meeting figuring out how to
                  attack the project from this new angle.

                  We also had some issues with the PORTAL database, having null/empty spots.
                  Mitigated this by ignoring the bad data as it came in. Also the
                  database was going through a restructure as we were working on it
                  which caused us to have to get clever with the stats query.
