            Answer these questions:
            What does your product do? Why is it needed? Who will use it?

            Routelandia is a native android app that
            shows travel times along highways. To do this, it
            pulls historical traffic data from highways around
            the general Portland area.

            The hook is this app won't just give you a travel
            time for just one moment, but before and after it as well.
            It does this by looking at travel times in the near past
            to predict them in the future.

            Traffic tends to follow cycles, as anyone in
            rush-hour traffic can tell you. Routelandia lets you
            conveniently see what those cycles look like,
            letting anyone know when's the best time to hit the road.

            ITS is an organization that has a place here at PSU. It stands for "Intelligent Transportation Systems". ITS' role here
            is to collect and analyze various information about traffic.
            PORTAL is a sub-group within ITS that has a more specific role. It stands for Portland, Oregon Regional Transportation
            Archive Listing. Their goal is to collect and archive various traffic data and statistics in the Portland Metro area.

            Nasim:  A powerful feature of information is performance-based trend representation. 
            Collecting -> diagnostics and statistical inference -> visualization and analysis of parameters -> performance trend -> optimization and evolutionary adaptation to rate of change.

                Our data is postgre with postGIS plugin, we only read the data

                The server is written by PHP language bases REST API with Restler framework

                The app talks to the server via Rest API, the map layout provided via Google Maps API

                The app was published in Google Play Store, if you're unclear about the functionality of the app,
                you can download the app at URL above into your phone and play with it.

              The two primary languages we used were Java, to create the front end,
              and php to create the back end. The supplied database was written in
              Postgres, and the back and front end communicate through a REST API with
              JSON objects.
              
              The front end mostly focused on using the supplied Android libraries
              to create the app, but several other libraries were used as well.
              The PolyUtil library allowed us to restrict users to only placing
              markers near our highways, improving the user experience, and 
              AChartEngine (yes,that's it's name) let us elegantly display our
              statistics.
              
              The back end also used some libraries in their programming.
              Restler allowed us to not just create but automatically document
              rest endpoints to communicate with the app. We also used
              respect/relational to manage the different database objects,
              and it all was tested using behat.

              <p>
                So, who did what? I split the teams up into three separate
                groups initially: Front-end, Back-end and UI design. UI
                design was a temporary team composed of Nasim and Jesse. They
                were responsible with coming up with the look of the
                front-end app. Once that was finished, I re-assigned Nasim to
                the front-end and Jesse to the back-end.
              </p>
              <p>NEXT FRAGMENT - PRESS DOWN!!!</p>
              <p>
                The front-end was composed of Loc, John and later
                Nasim. Loc was put in charge of the sub-group and
                responsible for putting down the groundwork for the
                application. Nasim implemented several of the graphical
                features such as the splash screen, date and time picker,
                and statistics plot. John worked on testing and doing QA
                work.
              </p>
              <p>NEXT FRAGMENT - PRESS DOWN!!!</p>
              <p>
                The back-end had Josh, Peter and then Jesse. Josh was the
                lead, bearded Wizard (their choice of title) and laid the
                foundation for the server application as well as writing
                the Postgres queries. Peter wrote lots of PHP code and took
                the lead with working with the Front-end and decided how
                the API structure would be implemented. When Jesse came on
                board, because of his experience writing test code at work,
                he took over the role of writing the entire test suite.

              <aside class="notes">
                OWNER: Rob
                <p>Each of our schedules varied greatly. John has a full-time
                work schedule, Nasim is a student at two universities,
                Jesse has a job and a family. With this situation, we had
                to adopt a "modified" agile development method. It was not
                possible to hold daily standups, but we did have weekly
                meetings where we tracked our progress and set goals for
                the following week.</p>

                <p>Since our last presentation, we've had a few changes to the
                schedule we laid out for ourselves. As stated earlier, we
                were unable to implement highway chaining, but refined our
                monthly milestones such as successfully drawing lines over
                the freeways where there was data and writing queries for
                route statistics.</p>

                <p>Our handoff is pretty simple. Since our software is free,
                Portal will only need to deploy a build on their servers
                which the app on the Playstore will reference. No signing
                over rights or IP is necessary for this project.</p>

              We discovered we would not be able to associate attributes to drawn
              lines on google maps which caused us to have to restructure our project.
              We responded by having one particularly long meeting figuring out how to
              attack the project from this new angle.

                What we would’ve done differently

                <p>First off in the backend, we would’ve wanted to choose a different language from PHP because PHP
                    comes with a lot of quirks. Additionally the frameworks for PHP we were using didn’t have much
                    support or documentation which made debugging difficult. The lack of search results outside of
                    their main website is something that should’ve sent up red flags in the start during our research.
                    Respect relational for example, required us to delve into their source code to figure out what was
                    going on and how to get it to do what we wanted it to do, even for tasks we thought would be simple,
                    like sending a raw SQL query to the database. The RESTler framework was better, had questions on
                    stack overflow and barebones documentation allowed us to get by without delving into the source code.</p>

                <p>Something both the front end and back end didn’t do was setting up a proper testing environment
                    before we started writing code. For most of the project the backend was testing all the api routes
                    by hand which caused some niche api routes to break when someone forgot to test every single
                    one with every commit. In a perfect world code reviews would catch these but some still managed
                    to split through the cracks. It also made it hard to debug communication issues between front end
                    and back end. When frontend would try to call an api route and it would break, it was always initially
                    unclear if it was actually frontend’s or backend’s code at fault. Usually it was some combination
                    of both.</p>

                <p>Front end initially assumed that android studios native android emulator would be sufficient
                    enough to work on. However the emulator ran incredibly slow on our machines, to the point of
                    making programming an incredibly frustrating process spending lots of time waiting instead
                    of being productive. By the end front end had a couple of old android phones being shared
                    between them which turned out to be better.</p>

                <p>Backend had the advantage of having someone with previous technical leadership experience,
                    so we were able to set up a schedule we could all work in from the get-go that kept us on the
                    same page. Because front end team members, like the rest of the team except josh, were all very
                    new working in a project like this, they had some issues figuring out what worked for them and how
                    to really get on their feet in terms of communication, goal setting and issue tracking. If they
                    could do it over again they would’ve used the same management strategies that backend was using.</p>

                <p>If we were where we are at now a month ago, we would’ve started working on an
                    iOS app. Most of the team could work on it since the API wouldn’t change, and we could
                    use the lessons we learned from building the android app and apply them. </p>

                NEXT
                <br />
                <p>However before we started the iOS app we’d want to work on multi-highway routing
                    first because this was initially supposed to be in the app but had to be made a stretch
                    goal after we did a major design change in terms of how the app communicated with the
                    server. We discussed a lot of kind’ve hacky ways to go about it but would want to avoid
                    because they relied on PHP doing the number crunching  instead of keeping all that
                    heavy computation inside the database.  After some research we discovered pg_routing
                    would best suit our needs but it would require some non-trivial design changes in the
                    PORTAL database which would take time than we had to implement. </p>

                NEXT
                <br />
                <p>Finally we wanted to add some kind of error reporting as a tool for us and PORTAL
                    to highlight missing or incorrect data in the PORTAL database. This would let us know
                    how far off the mark our predictions were for travel time. </p>

              For most of us, this was the first time we had worked on a group coding project. we had some issues with communication between
			  different team members and teams but we worked hard at it and things got better. many of us had never coded for an android app
			  or setup a web server before and now we have gained skills we can hopefully use after school. This has been a rewarding 
			  experience for all of us and we hope our project is useful. Thank you
